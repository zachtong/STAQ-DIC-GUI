"""Compile the Numba kernels in the background, before the user needs them.

The solver kernels are JIT-compiled on first use. Numba caches the result on
disk, so this is a once-per-installation cost -- but it is a large one, and it
lands at the worst possible moment: the user clicks *Run DIC Analysis* and the
interface stops responding for tens of seconds with nothing to explain it.

Measured on a 24-thread workstation, with every cache cleared and both halves
timed in one process so no disk cache can flatter the result:

    no warm-up      first real correlation   32.1 s
    with warm-up    warm-up (background)     41.1 s
                    first real correlation    0.1 s

A four-core laptop is slower on both counts.

To someone who installed by unzipping a folder and double-clicking, that reads
as a crash -- and killing the process is the one response that makes it
permanent, because the cache is written only when compilation finishes.

So compilation starts a couple of seconds after the window appears and overlaps
what the user does first: browsing for images in a file dialog, drawing a
region of interest. The warm-up correlation is small, but not arbitrarily so --
see WARMUP_IMAGE_PX. Numba's compiler runs Python bytecode and holds the GIL, so
the interface is less responsive while this runs. That is a better trade than a
dead window after a button press, and it is not repeated.

Why a daemon ``threading.Thread`` and not a ``QThread``: compilation cannot be
interrupted part-way, so a QThread would leave the application choosing between
aborting on close -- Qt calls ``abort()`` when a running QThread is destroyed,
the same failure mode as the export-dialog crash fixed in 0.7.2 -- and blocking
the exit for however long compilation has left. A daemon thread is reclaimed at
interpreter shutdown with neither problem. The one Qt object here is the signal
carrier, which lives on the main thread and receives a queued emission.
