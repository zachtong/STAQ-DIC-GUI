"""The startup warm-up must reach the kernels it exists to compile.

The solver dispatches on problem size: ``icgn_batch`` only calls the Numba
precompute kernels once a frame has at least 50 nodes. A warm-up correlation
below that threshold compiles a different, much cheaper set of signatures and
buys the user nothing -- which is exactly what happened at the first attempt:
warm-up finished in a quick 4.9 s and left the first real correlation as slow
as it had been with no warm-up at all.

Nothing in the type system connects the warm-up's image size to that threshold,
so this file is the connection.
